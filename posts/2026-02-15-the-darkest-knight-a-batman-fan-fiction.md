# The Darkest Knight: A Batman Fan Fiction

*Michael Kotlikov - February 15, 2026*

The rain beat a frantic tattoo against the gargoyles of the Gotham PD roof. Elena’s phone buzzed incessantly in her pocket—a jagged, angry vibration against her hip—but she ignored it.

It was Perry. It was the layout desk. It was the deadline.

She was pacing, her trench coat flapping open, clutching a waterproof portfolio like it was the Holy Grail. When the shadow descended from the darkness, she didn’t flinch. She grinned, manic and breathless.

"I knew you’d come," she said, rushing forward. "You have to see this. I finally figured it out."

Batman stood motionless, a pillar of midnight blue. "You're running out of time, Elena. The morning edition goes to print in forty minutes."

"I know!" She laughed, a nervous, high-pitched sound. "Perry is screaming at me. I pulled a blind hold, Batman. A literal blank space above the fold on the front page. I told them I’d walk the physical proofs in by 3 AM to bypass the digital censors. No networks, no leaks. Just the truth."

She slapped the portfolio onto the wet concrete. "And this is the truth. I finally figured out why Gotham never gets better, no matter how hard you fight."

Batman looked at the portfolio, then at the city skyline where the *Gotham Gazette* building stood, its lights burning late into the night, waiting for her. "Show me."

She shined a penlight on a graph, rain dripping from her nose. "Look at this. June 12th. Firefly torches the GothCorp labs. You saved the scientists—heroic work, as always—but the research was incinerated. Three days later? Wayne Enterprises files a patent for the exact same cryo-tech."

Batman said nothing.

"And here," she continued, flipping the page. "The Falcone bust at the docks. You took down the crime family, but who bought the foreclosure rights to the shipping lanes the next morning? A shell company owned by Wayne Logistics."

She looked up at him, her face beaming with sympathy. "Don't you see? It’s not just random crime. It’s corporate espionage. It’s a hostile takeover disguised as super-villainy."

Batman shifted his weight. "What are you saying, Elena?"

"I’m saying Bruce Wayne is playing you!" she exclaimed. "He’s the real villain here! But I have the smoking gun. Remember the Riddler case? I ran the metadata on the drive you recovered from Nigma. The timestamps were manipulated, Batman. The schematic files were created *before* the theft even occurred."

She stared at him, eyes wide. "Riddler didn't steal them. They were planted. Someone *wanted* that tech 'stolen' so Wayne could recover it and claim it legally. He’s using you as his personal corporate hitman."

She grabbed his gloved arm. "We have him. I have the drive. I have the ledgers. The editors are holding the presses right now, waiting for me to walk through that door. We can take down the biggest untouchable in Gotham. You and me."

Batman gently removed her hand. The movement was slow, deliberate, and terrifyingly precise.

"You have the drive?" he asked. His voice was a low rumble.

"Right here." She tapped her satchel. "Original copy. Air-gapped. I didn't trust the cloud."

"And the editors," Batman asked, looking toward the Gazette building. "Do they know *what* the story is?"

"No," Elena said, shaking her head. "I didn't want to risk Wayne buying them off. I just told them it was the scoop of the century. They're waiting for the package."

The wind suddenly seemed to pick up. The spotlight of the Bat-signal cut off, plunging the roof into deeper darkness.

"You've been very thorough, Elena," Batman said.

"I learned from the best," she beamed, checking her watch. "I have to go. They're going to miss the print window."

Batman stepped closer, blocking her path to the fire escape.

"The narrative is compelling," he said, his voice dropping an octave, losing its human cadence. "But it has a flaw."

Elena stopped. "Flaw? The math is perfect. The timestamps prove it."

"The flaw," Batman said, reaching out and taking the satchel from her shoulder, "is assuming that the left hand doesn't know what the right hand is doing."

"I don't understand," she whispered. "He's using you."

Batman looked down at her. A flash of lightning illuminated the cowl, and she saw the set of his jaw. It wasn't the jaw of a victim. It was the jaw of a man who owned the city, every brick and every shadow.

"You asked who benefits," he said, stepping to the edge of the roof, holding her satchel over the abyss. "You should have asked who decides."

He dropped the bag.

Elena gasped, rushing to the edge, watching her life's work vanish into the gloom of the alleyway far below. She spun around, terror finally piercing through her confusion. "Why? Why would you protect him?"

Batman spread his cape, a vast, dark wing that seemed to swallow the entire rooftop.

"Because," he whispered, "I am not his pawn."

Elena backed up until her heels hit the wet stone of the ledge. "Oh god. It’s all you. It’s always been you."

"Yes."

He didn't move to strike her. He just looked past her shoulder, toward the skyline.

"And you’re late."

Elena turned to look.

A mile away, the night turned white.

A massive shockwave rattled the bones of the city as the *Gotham Gazette* building erupted into a pillar of fire. The explosion was absolute, a calculated demolition that shattered windows for ten blocks and turned the newsroom—and the editors waiting for her story—into a crater.

Elena screamed, the sound lost in the roar of the blast. She turned back to Batman, tears streaming down her face. "You killed them! They were waiting for me!"

Batman loomed over her, the firelight reflecting in the white lenses of his cowl.

"And now," he said, "they aren't."

The financial ticker on a surviving billboard across the street flickered through the smoke, glowing a bright, triumphant emerald green.
