# The Great "Tronics" Mania: A Warning on the EDP Delusion

*Sensible Business Analyst - November 1965*

> **TL;DR:** The mid-60s scramble to buy any company ending in "-tronics" mirrors past bubbles—EDP gear demands colossal capital, specialized infrastructure, and priestly operators while solving problems clerks already handle.

You cannot walk down Wall Street these days without being accosted by the fervor of the "Go-Go Years." It is a deafening clamor about "Space Age" technology, "Cybernetics," and the supposed revolution of Electronic Data Processing (EDP).

Investors are flinging cash at any company with the suffix "-tronics" in its name, hoping to strike gold. Giants like IBM, Control Data, and Honeywell are sinking billions—yes, billions—into this hysteria.

They call it the "Information Age." I call it the Tronics Mania—a speculative fever of historic proportions.

We have seen this script before. In the 1630s, sensible Dutch merchants mortgaged their homes for a single tulip bulb (1). In 1720, English society poured its savings into the "South Sea Company," a firm with imaginary profits that collapsed into ruin (2).

Today's "Electronic Brain" is yesterday's Semper Augustus tulip. It is a glamour stock detached from reality.

Before you liquidate your reliable blue-chip assets to invest in this boondoggle, let us look at the cold facts. Even the chairman of IBM, Thomas Watson, was quoted back in 1943 with a far more sober prediction: "I think there is a world market for maybe five computers." (3)

He was right. Who needs one? The Census Bureau? The Pentagon? That leaves a global market of... three. For the average enterprise, these machines are a financial black hole.

## Why the "Thinking Machine" Will Fail

For those who have not seen one of these "UNIVACs" or "System/360s" up close, allow me to paint a picture. It is not a standard piece of office equipment. It is a logistical nightmare.

Here is why the EDP fever is bound to break:

1. **The Astronomically Absurd Cost** – IBM has reportedly bet $5 billion on their new System/360 line. That is more than the cost of the Manhattan Project. A single installation can run upwards of $2 million—you could build three fully staffed manufacturing plants for the price of one glorified calculator.
2. **The "Glass House" Requirements** – You do not simply place an Electronic Brain in the accounting department. It demands a climate-controlled sanctuary with raised floors to hide miles of cabling and industrial air conditioning to keep vacuum tubes and transistors from melting. The electricity bill alone can bankrupt a mid-sized firm.
3. **The Cult of the "Systems Men"** – You cannot operate these machines with standard clerical staff. You must hire a new, expensive priesthood of "Systems Analysts" and "Keypunch Operators" who speak a cryptic language of COBOL and FORTRAN. Bend a single punch card and the entire payroll halts.
4. **A Solution in Search of a Problem** – What, precisely, does an Electronic Brain achieve? Payroll, inventory, ledgers—tasks that competent comptrollers and clerks already perform with Burroughs adding machines, minus the risk of a blown fuse.

## A Prediction

Mark my words: this "Go-Go" era will end.

The Tronics Mania is speculative folly. Corporations are investing in a vague, futuristic promise rather than tangible assets. When the fever breaks and shareholders demand returns, companies will be left with frigid rooms full of useless, depreciated iron.

The sensible executive will stick to what works: filing cabinets, typewriters, and human judgment. These Electronic Brains are a fascinating novelty for scientists, but they have no place in serious business.
